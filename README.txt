Aim:
========

The purpose for this project is to accomplish the following:

Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
To create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
so from this we have the two data sets Training and Test sets.

For each record it is provided:
======================================

Test_data_x .... Generated Test data for X
Test_data_y ....Generated Test dataset for Y
Subject_text  
Train_data_x .... This represents the training data set for x
Train_data_y...... This represents the training data set for y
Subject_trainActivity_labels 

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================
"X_train.txt"
"y_train.txt"
"subject_train.txt"
"activity_labels.txt"
"X_test.txt"
"y_test.txt"
"subject_test.txt"
Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
